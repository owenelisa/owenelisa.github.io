### 🏁 First of all

i originally built this page because i rejected the idea of maintaining multiple
dating app profiles. so now all i gotta do is put a link to this page. i don’t really use dating apps anymore, but i put a decent amount of work into this so…

## Let the info dump begin

### 👪 Childrens

### 💘 Things I could never live without

- **companionship**. feeling completely comfortable as myself around you.
- **acceptance**. sharing a similar sense of humor. no fear of harsh judgements.
- **affirmation**. words and actions that show me that you truly give a damn about me.
- **affection**. a lot. except when i want to be alone.
- **solitude**. i still need space sometimes just don't be far away.

### 💼 What I’m doing with my life

- software engineer
- learning languages [duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/radsectors)

- still trying to figure out how to be an adult

### 💯 I’m really good at

- **flirting** ask my friends
- **computers** y’know how “Donatello does machines?” well, Owen does computers.
- **humor** laughing at my own jokes. talking to myself. coming up with obscure wordplay jokes that i can’t actually use because they take more time to explain than to deliver.

### 🤔 I spend a lot of time thinking about…

- trans rights, workers rights
- mental health
- what i can do to enjoy life more and get more out of it?
- what language should i study next?
- what was going on in Elisa Lam’s mind in her final hours?
